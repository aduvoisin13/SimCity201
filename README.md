#SimCity201
SimCity 201 Public Repository for Fall 2013.

###Team Work
The CSCI 201 Project teaches students about the myriad facets of team work: pair programming, team ethics, etc. Team 28 has embraced this team 
mentality and has approached the project accordingly. Although the following section lists _individual_ contributions, the project is the result of team contributions. Every section is the sum of the work of multiple members.

###Full Disclosure
Unfortunately, there are a few areas of the city that we were not able to complete to our satisfaction.

####General

####Restaurants
Occasional delays occur in some restaurants. Race conditions sometimes cause debilitating failure in our restaurants.
####Transportation
We modelled our transportation system off that of our own city, Los Angeles. Just like our fellow Angelinos, the denizens of SimCity also avoid taking public transportation at all costs. In fact, they do not ever take the bus and choose instead to walk.
